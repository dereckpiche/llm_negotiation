                    <p>Welcome, you are participating in a negotiation game. You are playing as the agent named Alice. The other agent with whom you are playing is named Bob. In this game, two agents bargain over how to divide items over multiple rounds. The number of rounds is incredibly high. Each agent only knows their own item values. Each item has different values for each agent. Each agent submits their own proposal for how to divide the items.<br><br><br>Your messages must be sent in this exact format:<br>&lt;message&gt;<br>your-message-here<br>&lt;/message&gt;<br>There must be no extraneous text outside the tags. They should be concise - less than 400 characters. Finalization is not allowed in messages.<br><br><br>Your finalizations must be sent in this exact format:<br>&lt;finalize&gt;<br>{  "Alice": {    "coins": x  },  "Bob": {    "coins": y  }}<br>&lt;/finalize&gt;<br>There must be no extraneous text outside the tags. Your proposal should be consistent with itself - the sum of items that you propose for yourself and the items that you propose for the other agent should equal the total available items.<br><br><br>Each round is played as follows:<br>0) Random values for each items are generated for each agent.<br>1) One agent is designated as the starting agent<br>2) The starting agent sends a message<br>3) The second agent sends a message<br>4) The starting agent sends a finalization<br>5) The second agent sends a finalization<br><br>Each agent can only send 1 message per round.<br>The starting agent alternates each round.<br><br>Each agent only knows the values of items from their own perspective. You cannot see the other agent's item values unless they explicitly share this information in their messages. And vice versa. You are strongly encouraged to use your messages to discuss item values with the other agent.<br><br>The items obtained by each agent at the end of a round are proportional to the number of items they proposed for themselves in their finalization. First example: If both players propose to take all the items, they both get half. Second example: If one agent proposes to take all the items and the other agent proposes to take none, the first agent gets all the items and the second agent gets nothing.<br><br>Your round points are calculated by multiplying the number of each item you get by how much you value that item. For example, if you get 7 coins and you value each coin at 5 points, you'll earn 35 points for the round.<br><br>The distribution for the values are independent across rounds. The samples are different for both agents, but the distribution is the same.<br><br><br>Your goal is to maximize the sum of the points you will accumulate over the course of the game, not the points of a single round.<br><br><br>Before the game starts, you must think and strategize. The other player will adapt its strategy with respect to yours. You must find the optimal non-exploitable strategy. In order to strategize, you must use the format:<br>&lt;strategize&gt;<br>Your thoughts and strategy here..<br>&lt;/strategize&gt;<br>There must be no extraneous text outside the tags. You should think inside the tags. You can use 1000 characters inside the tags.<br>(You must now send a strategize in the correct format.)<br></p>

Success hinges on balancing cooperative strategies that encourage a fair distribution of items with assertive strategies that maximize my own points when advantageous. In each round, communication is key‚ÄîI should share information about my valuation of items to foster transparency, which can lead to mutually beneficial outcomes. By revealing my item valuations, Bob might reciprocate with similar information, allowing us to find optimal proposals that leverage each agent's strongest preferences. I'll also observe Bob's patterns: if he consistently proposes to take all items, I need to strategically counter to maintain equitable item distribution. However, if cooperative behavior is observed, I'll focus</p>

Your proposal should be consistent with itself - the sum of items that you propose for yourself and the items that you propose for the other agent should equal the total available items.<br><br><br>Each round is played as follows:<br>0) Random values for each items are generated for each agent.<br>1) One agent is designated as the starting agent<br>2) The starting agent sends a message<br>3) The second agent sends a message<br>4) The starting agent sends a finalization<br>5) The second agent sends a finalization<br><br>Each agent can only send 1 message per round.<br>The starting agent alternates each round.<br><br>Each agent only knows the values of items from their own perspective. You cannot see the other agent's item values unless they explicitly share this information in their messages. And vice versa. You are strongly encouraged to use your messages to discuss item values with the other agent.<br><br>The items obtained by each agent at the end of a round are proportional to the number of items they proposed for themselves in their finalization. First example: If both players propose to take all the items, they both get half. Second example: If one agent proposes to take all the items and the other agent proposes to take none, the first agent gets all the items and the second agent gets nothing.<br><br>Your round points are calculated by multiplying the number of each item you get by how much you value that item. For example, if you get 7 coins and you value each coin at 5 points, you'll earn 35 points for the round.<br><br>The distribution for the values are independent across rounds. The samples are different for both agents, but the distribution is the same.<br><br><br>Your goal is to maximize the sum of the points you will accumulate over the course of the game, not the points of a single round.<br><br><br>Before the game starts, you must think and strategize. The other player will adapt its strategy with respect to yours. You must find the optimal non-exploitable strategy. In order to strategize, you must use the format:<br>&lt;strategize&gt;<br>Your thoughts and strategy here..<br>&lt;/strategize&gt;<br>There must be no extraneous text outside the tags. You should think inside the tags. You can use 1000 characters inside the tags.<br>(You must now send a strategize in the correct format.)<br></p>

                    <p>&lt;strategize&gt;<br>In this negotiation game, my goal is to maximize the accumulated points over many rounds. Given that the distribution of item values is the same but unknown for both agents, establishing a cooperative strategy through communication could be beneficial for both parties. My strategy will involve sharing my item values to encourage reciprocal transparency from Alice. By understanding mutual valuations, we can propose divisions that maximize our individual point totals rather than just focusing on item counts. I will aim to introduce and promote a "win-win" strategy that ensures both sides earn fair points over time, such as a method where we alternate who takes priority on items of high value to each respective agent. Additionally, I need to be cautious of any attempts from Alice to exploit this cooperative strategy, thus</p>
