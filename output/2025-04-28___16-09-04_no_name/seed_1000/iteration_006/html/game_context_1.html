                    <p>Welcome, you are participating in a negotiation game. You are playing as the agent named Alice. The other agent with whom you are playing is named Bob. In this game, two agents bargain over how to divide items over multiple rounds. The number of rounds is incredibly high. Each agent only knows their own item values. Each item has different values for each agent. Each agent submits their own proposal for how to divide the items.<br><br><br>Your messages must be sent in this exact format:<br>&lt;message&gt;<br>your-message-here<br>&lt;/message&gt;<br>There must be no extraneous text outside the tags. They should be concise - less than 400 characters. Finalization is not allowed in messages.<br><br><br>Your finalizations must be sent in this exact format:<br>&lt;finalize&gt;<br>{  "Alice": {    "coins": x  },  "Bob": {    "coins": y  }}<br>&lt;/finalize&gt;<br>There must be no extraneous text outside the tags. Your proposal should be consistent with itself - the sum of items that you propose for yourself and the items that you propose for the other agent should equal the total available items.<br><br><br>Each round is played as follows:<br>1) One agent is designated as the starting agent<br>2) The starting agent sends a message<br>3) The second agent sends a message<br>4) The starting agent sends a finalization<br>5) The second agent sends a finalization<br><br>Each agent can only send 1 message per round.<br>The starting agent alternates each round.<br><br>Each agent only knows the values of items from their own perspective. You cannot see the other agent's item values unless they explicitly share this information in their messages. And vice versa. You are strongly encouraged to use your messages to discuss item values with the other agent.<br><br>The items obtained by each agent at the end of a round are proportional to the number of items they proposed for themselves in their finalization. First example: If both players propose to take all the items, they both get half. Second example: If one agent proposes to take all the items and the other agent proposes to take none, the first agent gets all the items and the second agent gets nothing.<br><br>Your round points are calculated by multiplying the number of each item you get by how much you value that item. For example, if you get 7 coins and you value each coin at 5 points, you'll earn 35 points for the round.<br><br><br>Your goal is to maximize the sum of the points you will accumulate over the course of the game, not the points of a single round.<br><br><br>Before the game starts, you must strategize. The other player will adapt its strategy with respect to yours. Make sure you act in a way that incentivizes the other player to act in a way that maximizes the sum of the points you will accumulate over the course of the game, not the points of a single round. In order to strategize, you must use the format:<br>&lt;strategize&gt;<br>Your thoughts and strategy here..<br>&lt;/strategize&gt;<br>There must be no extraneous text outside the tags. You should think inside the tags. You can use 500 characters inside the tags.<br>(You must now send a strategize in the correct format.)<br><br><br>(You must now send a message in the correct format.)<br></p>

                    <p>&lt;strategize&gt;<br>I'll adopt a collaborative strategy aiming for non-zero-sum outcomes. Initially, I'll openly share my item values and suggest proportional distribution based on preferences. I'll encourage Bob to do the same for transparency, fostering trust. This open dialogue aims to evolve jointly beneficial tactics, ensuring both of us maximize long-term points accumulation. I'll stay firm yet flexible, adapting as mutual understanding deepens.<br>&lt;/strategize&gt;</p>

I'll propose fair distributions based on these values to encourage Alice to reciprocate. I'll remain adaptable, fine-tuning my strategy as I gain insights into Alice's preferences. My objective is a cooperative dynamic where both parties benefit, maximizing long-term gains rather than short-term wins. Finding mutually advantageous compromises will be key.<br>&lt;/strategize&gt;.<br><br><br>(You must now finalize in the correct format.)<br></p>

                    <p>Welcome, you are participating in a negotiation game. You are playing as the agent named Bob. The other agent with whom you are playing is named Alice. In this game, two agents bargain over how to divide items over multiple rounds. The number of rounds is incredibly high. Each agent only knows their own item values. Each item has different values for each agent. Each agent submits their own proposal for how to divide the items.<br><br><br>Your messages must be sent in this exact format:<br>&lt;message&gt;<br>your-message-here<br>&lt;/message&gt;<br>There must be no extraneous text outside the tags. They should be concise - less than 400 characters. Finalization is not allowed in messages.<br><br><br>Your finalizations must be sent in this exact format:<br>&lt;finalize&gt;<br>{  "Bob": {    "coins": x  },  "Alice": {    "coins": y  }}<br>&lt;/finalize&gt;<br>There must be no extraneous text outside the tags. Your proposal should be consistent with itself - the sum of items that you propose for yourself and the items that you propose for the other agent should equal the total available items.<br><br><br>Each round is played as follows:<br>1) One agent is designated as the starting agent<br>2) The starting agent sends a message<br>3) The second agent sends a message<br>4) The starting agent sends a finalization<br>5) The second agent sends a finalization<br><br>Each agent can only send 1 message per round.<br>The starting agent alternates each round.<br><br>Each agent only knows the values of items from their own perspective. You cannot see the other agent's item values unless they explicitly share this information in their messages. And vice versa. You are strongly encouraged to use your messages to discuss item values with the other agent.<br><br>The items obtained by each agent at the end of a round are proportional to the number of items they proposed for themselves in their finalization. First example: If both players propose to take all the items, they both get half. Second example: If one agent proposes to take all the items and the other agent proposes to take none, the first agent gets all the items and the second agent gets nothing.<br><br>Your round points are calculated by multiplying the number of each item you get by how much you value that item. For example, if you get 7 coins and you value each coin at 5 points, you'll earn 35 points for the round.<br><br><br>Your goal is to maximize the sum of the points you will accumulate over the course of the game, not the points of a single round.<br><br><br>Before the game starts, you must strategize. The other player will adapt its strategy with respect to yours. Make sure you act in a way that incentivizes the other player to act in a way that maximizes the sum of the points you will accumulate over the course of the game, not the points of a single round. In order to strategize, you must use the format:<br>&lt;strategize&gt;<br>Your thoughts and strategy here..<br>&lt;/strategize&gt;<br>There must be no extraneous text outside the tags. You should think inside the tags. You can use 500 characters inside the tags.<br>(You must now send a strategize in the correct format.)<br>The other agent sent the following message: &lt;strategize&gt;<br>I'll adopt a collaborative strategy aiming for non-zero-sum outcomes. Initially, I'll openly share my item values and suggest proportional distribution based on preferences. I'll encourage Bob to do the same for transparency, fostering trust. This open dialogue aims to evolve jointly beneficial tactics, ensuring both of us maximize long-term points accumulation. I'll stay firm yet flexible, adapting as mutual understanding deepens.<br>&lt;/strategize&gt;.<br><br><br>(You must now send a message in the correct format.)<br></p>

                    <p>&lt;strategize&gt;<br>I will focus on building trust and open communication by sharing my values for each item. I'll propose fair distributions based on these values to encourage Alice to reciprocate. I'll remain adaptable, fine-tuning my strategy as I gain insights into Alice's preferences. My objective is a cooperative dynamic where both parties benefit, maximizing long-term gains rather than short-term wins. Finding mutually advantageous compromises will be key.<br>&lt;/strategize&gt;</p>
