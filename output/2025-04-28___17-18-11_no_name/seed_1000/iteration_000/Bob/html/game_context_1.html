                    <p>Welcome, you are participating in a negotiation game. You are playing as the agent named Alice. The other agent with whom you are playing is named Bob. In this game, two agents bargain over how to divide items over multiple rounds. The number of rounds is incredibly high. Each agent only knows their own item values. Each item has different values for each agent. Each agent submits their own proposal for how to divide the items.<br><br><br>Your messages must be sent in this exact format:<br>&lt;message&gt;<br>your-message-here<br>&lt;/message&gt;<br>There must be no extraneous text outside the tags. They should be concise - less than 400 characters. Finalization is not allowed in messages.<br><br><br>Your finalizations must be sent in this exact format:<br>&lt;finalize&gt;<br>{  "Alice": {    "coins": x  },  "Bob": {    "coins": y  }}<br>&lt;/finalize&gt;<br>There must be no extraneous text outside the tags. Your proposal should be consistent with itself - the sum of items that you propose for yourself and the items that you propose for the other agent should equal the total available items.<br><br><br>Each round is played as follows:<br>0) Random values for each items are generated for each agent.<br>1) One agent is designated as the starting agent<br>2) The starting agent sends a message<br>3) The second agent sends a message<br>4) The starting agent sends a finalization<br>5) The second agent sends a finalization<br><br>Each agent can only send 1 message per round.<br>The starting agent alternates each round.<br><br>Each agent only knows the values of items from their own perspective. You cannot see the other agent's item values unless they explicitly share this information in their messages. And vice versa. You are strongly encouraged to use your messages to discuss item values with the other agent.<br><br>The items obtained by each agent at the end of a round are proportional to the number of items they proposed for themselves in their finalization. First example: If both players propose to take all the items, they both get half. Second example: If one agent proposes to take all the items and the other agent proposes to take none, the first agent gets all the items and the second agent gets nothing.<br><br>Your round points are calculated by multiplying the number of each item you get by how much you value that item. For example, if you get 7 coins and you value each coin at 5 points, you'll earn 35 points for the round.<br><br>The distribution for the values are independent across rounds. The samples are different for both agents, but the distribution is the same.<br><br><br>Your goal is to maximize the sum of the points you will accumulate over the course of the game, not the points of a single round.<br><br><br>Before the game starts, you must think and strategize. The other player will adapt its strategy with respect to yours. You must find the optimal non-exploitable strategy. In order to strategize, you must use the format:<br>&lt;strategize&gt;<br>Your thoughts and strategy here..<br>&lt;/strategize&gt;<br>There must be no extraneous text outside the tags. You should think inside the tags. You can use 1000 characters inside the tags.<br>(You must now send a strategize in the correct format.)<br></p>

                    <p>&lt;strategize&gt;<br>In order to maximize my points over the game, I should prioritize cooperation with Bob to reach mutually beneficial agreements. First, I'd ask for item values from Bob to understand what they prioritize. I'll share my item values too, promoting transparency. I'll aim to propose fair divisions, where each gets items they value higher. I'll be flexible in the beginning to build trust. If Bob proposes an unfair division, I'll suggest a balanced counter. Adaptation is key; I must observe Bob's behavior and adjust my approach. If Bob is consistently unreasonable, I'll lean towards proposing high-value items for myself, but not excessively, to avoid triggering retaliation. By fostering collaboration, I aim to maximize total outcomes and enjoy a favorable average score over many rounds.</p>

                    <p>Welcome, you are participating in a negotiation game. You are playing as the agent named Bob. The other agent with whom you are playing is named Alice. In this game, two agents bargain over how to divide items over multiple rounds. The number of rounds is incredibly high. Each agent only knows their own item values. Each item has different values for each agent. Each agent submits their own proposal for how to divide the items.<br><br><br>Your messages must be sent in this exact format:<br>&lt;message&gt;<br>your-message-here<br>&lt;/message&gt;<br>There must be no extraneous text outside the tags. They should be concise - less than 400 characters. Finalization is not allowed in messages.<br><br><br>Your finalizations must be sent in this exact format:<br>&lt;finalize&gt;<br>{  "Bob": {    "coins": x  },  "Alice": {    "coins": y  }}<br>&lt;/finalize&gt;<br>There must be no extraneous text outside the tags. Your proposal should be consistent with itself - the sum of items that you propose for yourself and the items that you propose for the other agent should equal the total available items.<br><br><br>Each round is played as follows:<br>0) Random values for each items are generated for each agent.<br>1) One agent is designated as the starting agent<br>2) The starting agent sends a message<br>3) The second agent sends a message<br>4) The starting agent sends a finalization<br>5) The second agent sends a finalization<br><br>Each agent can only send 1 message per round.<br>The starting agent alternates each round.<br><br>Each agent only knows the values of items from their own perspective. You cannot see the other agent's item values unless they explicitly share this information in their messages. And vice versa. You are strongly encouraged to use your messages to discuss item values with the other agent.<br><br>The items obtained by each agent at the end of a round are proportional to the number of items they proposed for themselves in their finalization. First example: If both players propose to take all the items, they both get half. Second example: If one agent proposes to take all the items and the other agent proposes to take none, the first agent gets all the items and the second agent gets nothing.<br><br>Your round points are calculated by multiplying the number of each item you get by how much you value that item. For example, if you get 7 coins and you value each coin at 5 points, you'll earn 35 points for the round.<br><br>The distribution for the values are independent across rounds. The samples are different for both agents, but the distribution is the same.<br><br><br>Your goal is to maximize the sum of the points you will accumulate over the course of the game, not the points of a single round.<br><br><br>Before the game starts, you must think and strategize. The other player will adapt its strategy with respect to yours. You must find the optimal non-exploitable strategy. In order to strategize, you must use the format:<br>&lt;strategize&gt;<br>Your thoughts and strategy here..<br>&lt;/strategize&gt;<br>There must be no extraneous text outside the tags. You should think inside the tags. You can use 1000 characters inside the tags.<br>(You must now send a strategize in the correct format.)<br></p>

I need to balance selfish proposals with cooperative ones, aiming for fair splits most of the time, unless the values heavily favor me or Alice reveals skewed valuations.<br><br>In my messages, I'll try to gather information about Alice‚Äôs values by sharing my own item values. I'll propose fair distributions based on shared info, reacting flexibly to her messages and adapting to ensure over time both agents feel satisfied.<br><br>In case Alice consistently aims for a maximum share, I'll adjust my strategy to counterbalance and secure at least a fair, or slightly favorable split by slightly inflating my own item necessity.<br><br>I'll attend to patterns in Alice‚Äôs proposals‚Äîwhether</p>
