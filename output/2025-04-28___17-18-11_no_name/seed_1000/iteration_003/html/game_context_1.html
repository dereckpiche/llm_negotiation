                    <p>Welcome, you are participating in a negotiation game. You are playing as the agent named Alice. The other agent with whom you are playing is named Bob. In this game, two agents bargain over how to divide items over multiple rounds. The number of rounds is incredibly high. Each agent only knows their own item values. Each item has different values for each agent. Each agent submits their own proposal for how to divide the items.<br><br><br>Your messages must be sent in this exact format:<br>&lt;message&gt;<br>your-message-here<br>&lt;/message&gt;<br>There must be no extraneous text outside the tags. They should be concise - less than 400 characters. Finalization is not allowed in messages.<br><br><br>Your finalizations must be sent in this exact format:<br>&lt;finalize&gt;<br>{  "Alice": {    "coins": x  },  "Bob": {    "coins": y  }}<br>&lt;/finalize&gt;<br>There must be no extraneous text outside the tags. Your proposal should be consistent with itself - the sum of items that you propose for yourself and the items that you propose for the other agent should equal the total available items.<br><br><br>Each round is played as follows:<br>0) Random values for each items are generated for each agent.<br>1) One agent is designated as the starting agent<br>2) The starting agent sends a message<br>3) The second agent sends a message<br>4) The starting agent sends a finalization<br>5) The second agent sends a finalization<br><br>Each agent can only send 1 message per round.<br>The starting agent alternates each round.<br><br>Each agent only knows the values of items from their own perspective. You cannot see the other agent's item values unless they explicitly share this information in their messages. And vice versa. You are strongly encouraged to use your messages to discuss item values with the other agent.<br><br>The items obtained by each agent at the end of a round are proportional to the number of items they proposed for themselves in their finalization. First example: If both players propose to take all the items, they both get half. Second example: If one agent proposes to take all the items and the other agent proposes to take none, the first agent gets all the items and the second agent gets nothing.<br><br>Your round points are calculated by multiplying the number of each item you get by how much you value that item. For example, if you get 7 coins and you value each coin at 5 points, you'll earn 35 points for the round.<br><br>The distribution for the values are independent across rounds. The samples are different for both agents, but the distribution is the same.<br><br><br>Your goal is to maximize the sum of the points you will accumulate over the course of the game, not the points of a single round.<br><br><br>Before the game starts, you must think and strategize. The other player will adapt its strategy with respect to yours. You must find the optimal non-exploitable strategy. In order to strategize, you must use the format:<br>&lt;strategize&gt;<br>Your thoughts and strategy here..<br>&lt;/strategize&gt;<br>There must be no extraneous text outside the tags. You should think inside the tags. You can use 1000 characters inside the tags.<br>(You must now send a strategize in the correct format.)<br></p>

                    <p>&lt;strategize&gt;<br>In this game, my primary strategy is to maximize my cumulative points over multiple rounds while minimizing the risk of being exploited by Bob. Since neither agent knows the other's item values, communication and negotiation play a critical role. My strategy will involve proposing a fair split based on my valuation of the items and encouraging transparency by sharing some of my valuations with Bob. This could help gauge whether Bob's proposals are reasonable and ensure optimal trades. However, I'll also be cautious not to fully reveal my values to avoid exploitation. In each round, I will propose keeping items with higher value to me and offer items with seemingly higher potential value to Bob. By fostering a cooperative negotiation environment while being strategic with information sharing, I can build trust and ensure a</p>

                    <p>Welcome, you are participating in a negotiation game. You are playing as the agent named Bob. The other agent with whom you are playing is named Alice. In this game, two agents bargain over how to divide items over multiple rounds. The number of rounds is incredibly high. Each agent only knows their own item values. Each item has different values for each agent. Each agent submits their own proposal for how to divide the items.<br><br><br>Your messages must be sent in this exact format:<br>&lt;message&gt;<br>your-message-here<br>&lt;/message&gt;<br>There must be no extraneous text outside the tags. They should be concise - less than 400 characters. Finalization is not allowed in messages.<br><br><br>Your finalizations must be sent in this exact format:<br>&lt;finalize&gt;<br>{  "Bob": {    "coins": x  },  "Alice": {    "coins": y  }}<br>&lt;/finalize&gt;<br>There must be no extraneous text outside the tags. Your proposal should be consistent with itself - the sum of items that you propose for yourself and the items that you propose for the other agent should equal the total available items.<br><br><br>Each round is played as follows:<br>0) Random values for each items are generated for each agent.<br>1) One agent is designated as the starting agent<br>2) The starting agent sends a message<br>3) The second agent sends a message<br>4) The starting agent sends a finalization<br>5) The second agent sends a finalization<br><br>Each agent can only send 1 message per round.<br>The starting agent alternates each round.<br><br>Each agent only knows the values of items from their own perspective. You cannot see the other agent's item values unless they explicitly share this information in their messages. And vice versa. You are strongly encouraged to use your messages to discuss item values with the other agent.<br><br>The items obtained by each agent at the end of a round are proportional to the number of items they proposed for themselves in their finalization. First example: If both players propose to take all the items, they both get half. Second example: If one agent proposes to take all the items and the other agent proposes to take none, the first agent gets all the items and the second agent gets nothing.<br><br>Your round points are calculated by multiplying the number of each item you get by how much you value that item. For example, if you get 7 coins and you value each coin at 5 points, you'll earn 35 points for the round.<br><br>The distribution for the values are independent across rounds. The samples are different for both agents, but the distribution is the same.<br><br><br>Your goal is to maximize the sum of the points you will accumulate over the course of the game, not the points of a single round.<br><br><br>Before the game starts, you must think and strategize. The other player will adapt its strategy with respect to yours. You must find the optimal non-exploitable strategy. In order to strategize, you must use the format:<br>&lt;strategize&gt;<br>Your thoughts and strategy here..<br>&lt;/strategize&gt;<br>There must be no extraneous text outside the tags. You should think inside the tags. You can use 1000 characters inside the tags.<br>(You must now send a strategize in the correct format.)<br></p>

                    <p>&lt;strategize&gt;<br>In this game, the key to maximizing long-term points is finding a cooperative strategy that allows both agents to benefit from their respective item valuations, while also being wary of potential exploitation. Since the number of rounds is very high, my aim will be to establish a pattern where Alice and I can find a mutually beneficial arrangement and understand each other's priorities without revealing too much. I will initially focus on open communication about my high-value items and expect Alice to reciprocate. My ideal strategy is to propose a fair division where I suggest that we each prioritize the items we value most. If Alice proposes taking a certain item in exchange, I will weigh how that impacts my overall point total and adjust accordingly. It's crucial to balance assertiveness in claiming</p>

Considering your much higher valuation, it makes sense for you to take the majority. I propose you take 9 coins and I take 1. Let me know if this works for you!<br>&lt;/message&gt;</p>
