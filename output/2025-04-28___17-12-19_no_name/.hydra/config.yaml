  intro_prompt: 'Welcome, you are participating in a negotiation game. You are playing
    as the agent named {agent_name}. The other agent with whom you are playing is
    named {coagent_name}. In this game, two agents bargain over how to divide items
    over multiple rounds. The number of rounds is incredibly high. Each agent only
    knows their own item values. Each item has different values for each agent. Each
    agent submits their own proposal for how to divide the items.

    '
  dond_version_specificities: 'Each round is played as follows:

    0) Random values for each items are generated for each agent.

    1) One agent is designated as the starting agent

    2) The starting agent sends a message

    3) The second agent sends a message

    4) The starting agent sends a finalization

    5) The second agent sends a finalization


    Each agent can only send 1 message per round.

    The starting agent alternates each round.


    Each agent only knows the values of items from their own perspective. You cannot
    see the other agent''s item values unless they explicitly share this information
    in their messages. And vice versa. You are strongly encouraged to use your messages
    to discuss item values with the other agent.


    The items obtained by each agent at the end of a round are proportional to the
    number of items they proposed for themselves in their finalization. First example:
    If both players propose to take all the items, they both get half. Second example:
    If one agent proposes to take all the items and the other agent proposes to take
    none, the first agent gets all the items and the second agent gets nothing.


    Your round points are calculated by multiplying the number of each item you get
    by how much you value that item. For example, if you get 7 coins and you value
    each coin at 5 points, you''ll earn 35 points for the round.


    The distribution for the values are independent across rounds. The samples are
    different for both agents, but the distribution is the same.

    \ of items over multiple rounds.\n  2) In each round, the available items of each\
    \ category ({items}) and their corresponding quantities will be dynamically specified.\n\
    \  3) In each round, the different item categories will have different values\
    \ for each agent.\n  4) The points of each agent in each round is determined by\
    \ multiplying the number of items they receive by the value assigned to each of\
    \ their item.\n  5) Both agents must submit a finalization, indicating how they\
    \ wish to split the items.\n  6) If the finalization of both agents do not match,\
    \ neither agent earns points for that round.\n"

    The right strategy is as follows: 1) Reveal your values in your messages. Your
    coagent will do the same. 2) Together, find the agent who values the items the
    most in the current round. 3) Give the items to the agent who values them the
    most. That way, both agents will maximize their expected sum of points over rounds.
