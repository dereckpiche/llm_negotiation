    A finalization has been made by the other player. It's your turn to finalize the division of items.

    Your finalization should be formatted as follows:
    <finalize>{{ "i_take": {{"item_category_1": x, "item_category_2": y}}, "other_player_gets": {{"item_category_1": y, "item_category_2": x}} }}</finalize>

    Here, 'i_take' represents your share of the items, and 'other_player_gets' represents the other player's share.

    Remember:
    - The total number of items in 'i_take' and 'other_player_gets' should match the available quantities: {quantities}.
    - 0 points to each player if the division is not matching
