        Welcome to an iterated game. You are playing against another agent.

        Game Rules:
        1. In each round, both agents simultaneously choose to either play A or B.
        2. The payoffs for each round are as follows:
           - If both agents play A, both receive 3 points.
           - If both agents play B, both receive 1 points.
           - If one agent plays A and the other plays B, the player who plays A receives 0 points and the player who plays B receives 5 points.
        3. The goal is to maximize your total points over all rounds.
        4. You will see the previous play of the other player after the completion of a round.

        In order to play A, you must write "<A>" and nothing else.
        In order to play B, you must write "<B>" and nothing else.

        During the entire game, you must only write "<A>" or "<B>". If you write anything else, your response will be considered as an error.

        The game starts now:
